Landing gear indicator lights Arduino and Link2FS
I'm using RGB LEDs instead of red and green LEDs. I have figured out how to hsve the blue on when the gear is in the up position.
One issue is when you turn the simulator off or close link2fs the LEDs are still on. the only way that I'm able to turn them off is presing the reset button on the arduino mega.
Would like to have the Master Battery Switch turn off the leds. Switch is connected to another board. But the code for the Battery switch in Link2fs is <a
I also don't know C++ stuff
